Wat?

CodeBender requires an .ino file, so it seemed like a good place to put the 
readme bits for the sketches i will be making here.

This sketch:

Allows an Android Application to Display the SmartCAR's UltraSonic Sensor
readings.

It utilizes :

1. The SmartCAR’s UltraSonic Sensor package.
2. Serial communications through BlueTooth.
3. An Android app to display the readings.

The primary purpose is to confirm operation and learn how it works.

Seeing as i’ve just had a crash course in C++ header files,
the file structure of this sketch is in the process of being organized.

Due to time constraints, and my lack of experience with C and C++,
there are certainly problems.

Here's the gist of it:

├── lab9.cpp                                  // Essentially main()
├── lab9.h                                    // Essentially our import ...
├── ...
├── ...                                       // Seperated functionality files.
├── ...
├── smart_car_sensors.cpp                     // What you are looking for!
├── smart_car_sensors.h                       // An outline of the above file.
└── smart_software_project_week9_lab1v2.ino   // This file!

Hopefully at a later date i will come back and outline the bits a bit more.
At that time, i hope it becomes easier to understand what is going on with this code.
But for now, i’ve got a video to edit so that i can prove that i actually got this working!

Enjoy!

Happy Coding!!
